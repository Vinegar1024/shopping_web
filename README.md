# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with React Redux and React Router

To run the app, run npm install, after all package installed

Run npm run start to start the script on (localhost: 3000)

Back-end mocked up by using firebase realtime database

The demo app can navigate among home page, shop and cart page, and product page, the url for fetch and update products is just a play ground for me to store and mock up data. 

You can edit product price and quantity in product page, add new product and search product by keyword

You can add product to cart and remove it from cart, see total price 

There are no unit test yet, and may have some error that didnt catch or have solution now
